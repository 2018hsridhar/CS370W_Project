--- Major topics to address ---
-------------------------------
1.  SGD
	-[A]. I don't have say, a formal paper to back up my techniques. 
		Additionally, I am technically NOT taking/moving along the directions of a gradient. I am just varying a couple of parameters/sub-matrices in the Transformation matrix. This seems ... kinda wrong
	- [B].  How to determine convergence well? Say, I test 100 diff matrices - what is the likeliehood that in the next iteration, my current energy, is (<=) energy of all other 100 matrices that I test in the next iteration? There should be a better manner of decent termination. 
	- [C]. This method , should be noted for being able to get stuck in a local minima, just like normal or conjugate gradient descent, right?
2. Experiemntal Design
	- [A] what other papaers should I read in the field, to understanding how they set up their experiments, and WHAT statistics/metrics they assessed? 
	- [B] At the moment, I am lacking any sort of experimental design. I feel that I am just willy-nilly testing my approach on a bunch of random scans ( the mirro planes, the reverse camel heads ). There should be a better way of doing this!
	- [C] Liek 4PCS - what do I want to very in my scans? The extend of overlap? Noise? Outliears? How they overlap/do not overlap? To always just set an identity mat, and take them directly in place? HOW many 3D-data, and from what sources too? What intrinsic properties of my input, can affect the algo ( we covered the symmetric versus elongated boundary case already )
3. Formalizing performance
	- How do I formalize Big-O performance? 
	- How do I conceptualize the run-time of certain components of the algorithm [ i.e. MCF, interp surface generatino and remeshing, SGD ]
4.ASo how well do I handle noisy arange scan data, or outliers?
	- Due to interpolating surface generation ... I feel that my method will not do so well, in these cases
	- Perhaps my method , while accepting more general inputs [ than JASNOM ] , is nort as robust as I think it proves.
5.What are ways that I think I can optimize my approach
	- [a] better interp surface construction
	- [b] assessment of other flows
	- [c] different  learning techniques?
	- [d] ANY preprocessing steps too? 
6. I am assuming that my inputs, are provided in arbitrary, initial poses! I am NOT fixing their poses ... for sure!






6. I think the reason one can't NAIVELY incorporate features, into our scheme ... is because features are used to establish correspondances, which are OVERLAPPING points, for commencing rigid or non-rigid alignment schemes. BUT we work specifically on non-overlapping inputs. Thus, such approaches will CLEARLY not aply to the problem domain! Examples include
	- RigidICP, and any of its variants
		- and really see http://www.pcl-users.org/file/n4037867/Rusinkiewicz_Effcient_Variants_of_ICP.pdf
		- see http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/CS395_Lecture_VII.pdfA for 3 variants - [ Point-PLane dist, Stable sampling, Robust norm ]

--- double check again ---
--------------------------
	- RANSAC, voting, spectral matching?  
	- 3D SIFT 
	- SPIN images 
	- see this paper ... https://www1.ethz.ch/igp/photogrammetry/publications/pdf_folder/novak_isprsw13.pdf ... for more info!
	- such things cannot be applied to our problem domain, DUE TO lack of correspondances!


7. Other work, such as JASNOM or 4PCS, also do not work on the case of overlap!
8. Applications of alignment INCLUDE
	- surface reconstruction
	- object reconsturction
	- fragment assembly	
	- protein docking - talk to Kevin Song, about applications in this domain!
