--- Goal of Bool operations ---
-------------------------------
Given a mesh, such as the horse
Take a rectangular box, and intersection with said mesh
Get 2/3 pieces
Move these pieces to different locations
Evaluate the alignment of those pieces

--- Bool operations on meshes ---
---------------------------------
CSG makes bool operations straightforward
	- shape surface = closure of all points x in A
	- open set of points x, where isTrue(a(x))
	- based on representation of complex surfaces by sets and set operations
Are there specific shapes I'm interested in ( see base-case representations )?
LibIGL - must work with [explicit, triangle mesh, boundary representations ] of solid shapes
	- NOTE :: this is what your two inputs are. We assume these as givens
	- what difficulties with CSG operations might arise here?
	- TO NOTE :: CSG operations are hard to compute robustly with boundary representations
The winding number 
	- used as a (2x)-tupel to label each "cell" bounded by the arrangement's surfaces
NOTE :: underneath this, you actually use CGAL :-P. Have fun with that! 
Yes, you'll get the same output type back. This is taken care of for you :-)

-----------------
--- QUESTIONS ---
-----------------
1. Do I have to worry if the mesh is manifold or not? 
2. Should I check out the cork boolean library too?
	- note :: this is going to be buggy. perhaps ignore for now
3. Speed vs. robustness
	- discuss this with Etienne
	- CGAL lib doesn't suffer robustness issues. But requires annoying configs GAAHH!
4. Do I have to worry about how internal structures are treated - see union, symm diff, and resolve
	- symmetric difference is also useful for alignment cases
	- internal surfaces REVERSED in orientation ---> could lead to future issues :-(
5. Do I need to use the "resolve" operation
	- eliminate intersections
	- glue coincident vertices
	- maintian original triangel orientations??

--- Relationship w/Winding Numbers ---
--------------------------------------
What is a Winding Number?
Only meshes that possess piecewise const winding numbers serve as valid inputs to solid set operations.
#TODO :: Read up on background underlying valid CSG inputs.
