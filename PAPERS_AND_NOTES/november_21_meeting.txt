--- THE NEXT STEPS TO BE MADE ! ---
-----------------------------------

1. FIND a set of background readings/papers to undersatnd heat curvature surface blending methods OR ask Nathan to send you this information
2. REVIEW critical code components that I need , from Nathan, and go over any confusing aspects. Some of the inputs and outputs to critical subroutines still confuse me !
3. WRITE more up ... over break, do write ups for { Rigid_ICP, MCF, Gradient Descent } . Read up critical background over Thanksgiving break, and IMPELMENT WHAT YOU CAN !!!
4. **** SET UP equation for evaluation of an alignment ( energy functional ) 

     - critical aspects that I need too consider for evaluation of an alignemnt / energy functional
     [1] gradient descent requires my functional to have a set of variables to evaluate it against ( area, curvature, tangents ... anything else ) ??
     [2] The functional needs to be at least ONCE differentiable . BUT if it is 2x differentiable, can I consider other methods ( i.e. Secant method ) ??
     [3] Will the fact that the function is convex or concave, for its ENTIRE or a SUBSET of the domain, come to matter?


5. **** SET UP equation for performing gradient descent on the alignment .. I understand a laymans gradient descent, but I don't undersand how this scales to a (4x4) matrix !

----------------------------------------------------
--- DOUBTS TO GO OVER WITH VOUGA [ OR OTHERS ]  ---
------------------------------------
1. Ensure you understand the deal with (manifold-watertight ) meshes and how they are related to the boundary, range / depth images  ! 
       Just to be clear, solving this boundary ; it is 3D data ! Nathan's code takes 2D data ( note :: that could be a type, or dumb limitation ) 
2. 

	[1] GENERATE an alignment between the two objects
	[2] CALCULATE the enclosing box, and tetrahedralize the entire box (add vertices where necessary)
	[3] MARK all original vertices as "hot" and perform heat flow until the number of connected components is 1
	[4] PERFORM curvature flow, keeping all* original vertices constant.

	I don't understand steps [2] and [3] 
        [2] Why is this tetrahedralization step critical? What is tetrahedralization, in fact ? 
        [3] so heat eminates from the FIXED CONSTANT vertices / original vertices, yet it is the new vertices that are getting deformed !
3.  What are the differences amongst { matching, alignment, surface reconstruction, surface modelling, leveling, blending, etc.,  } ? A lot of terms are used in a rather interchangeable manner !

--- What progress did I make this week --- 
-------------------------------------------
[a] I read the following papers :: 
    1.
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.

	I found that many of them are useful for thinking/extending future ideas
	BUT I also learned that most of them do not match my problem domain. 
	NONETHELESS, I can incorporate them as means of future extensions to my research
   		and try to incorporate the knowledge I learned from them !

[b] I set up various meetings with Nathan and Brady, to better understand their codebase and problem at hand

[c] I was able to better formalize my problem statement; wrote up a short abstract. 

[d] I got beter clarity on my existing knowledge base. I also learnt how to write up a depth report

[e] I found a set of more papers , and useful background too consider. This helped btter formalize the problem, and formalize an understanding of concepts such as ::
    [1] Geometric PDES and ideas of higher-order diffeqs + discretizations 
    [2] Rigid vs nonRigidIcp, and the set of characteristics that uniquely define Chen-Medioni's RigidICP algorithm

[f] I am VERY confident that my MCF is correct, and so too, is RigidICP

[g] Installed MeshLab, go to play around/use that .... SHIT, I still need to do this !

------------------------------
--- MAJOR RESEARCH LESSONS ---
------------------------------
[1] Just like documentation ,get your research into writing ! Writing really makes you hash out every compoennt that was initially difficult to understand ! Yes, its an annoying, BUT critical, step 
[2] Sometimes, going back over the basics can be useful
[3] A later paper can explain a concept better than the original paper
[4] If you can understand the intro-conclusion-abstract just like an SAT exam, you have a good enough idea of the paper, and can immediately ascertain whether it does or does not belong to your problem domain. 
[5] Be VERY consistent with making progress in research
[6] Learned how to collobarate amongst multiple researchers/people of different experience. Formulating a problem staetment well to thsoe who have no exposure to your domain is rather critical
