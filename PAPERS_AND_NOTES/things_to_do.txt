1. #TODO :: Restructure pipeline, with keyboard code, to do the following
	(a) restore original image data
	(b) apply MCF
	(c) apply rigidICp
	(d) test out the pipeline
	(e) generate and output useful statistics
2. eventualty determine if MCF::meshHasBoundary(), needs to be public, or private 
	-- honestly, this method is useless as fuck ! it's 2 lines to determine if there is a boundary !
	-- buit it's kinda a nice utility @ timsa ( perhaps for testing code, in the pipeline ! )
