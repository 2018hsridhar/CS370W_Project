1. SLE operations
    - implement this. Try to get it working

2. Basic codebase instrumentation
	- 20 trials, planes cases - throw them out in various positions
	- PROFILE everything
	- collect basic statistics
	- hand over statistics to Vouga
	- AVOID use of new SLE method here

3. <GProf, Valgrind> = more advanced instrumentation
	- Try to Instrument own codebase
	- [1] <pragma> optimizations?
	- [2] <other> optimizations?
