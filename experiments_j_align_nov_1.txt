3, 124 ... REMESH fails here. IDK why

5,

--- I expect that no matter how fine remeshing is, the number of trials/iterations to convergence stays constant.
It sems like the impulse based alignment scheme works, but failure occurs in remeshing of certain meshes? Unsure why
--- well, becuase of the remesh invariant, I really don't hav eto refine my remesh edge len.
--- Do I need to adjust for a proper 'h-value', or not? unsure here?
--- @ h = 1.0, this algo just keeps springing back-and-forth
--- @ h = 0.5, same behavior as h = 1.0, but more iterations
--- @ h = 0.025, this just tanks weirdly. It does converge in a nice number of iterations, and then starts to rotate in a weird manner. That shouldn't be happening.
--- @ h = 0.01, the algorithm looks completely reasonable.
