--- Condor stuff ---
--------------------
1. IO
2. Inputs and outputs - how to include these?
	- to load mesh in executable? seems inefficient
	- it is easy to generate perturbations. I can do that tommorrow for sure!
	- I believe there are optinos for this. See <in.$(Process)>?? ... hmmm ...
	- Pass in as <input> or <cmd_line_arg>?? ... hmmm ...
3. Vector visualization - gmm lib doesn't actually work. Problem on their end?
4. CSG bool opers - uhh, plane cutting doesn't work. winding numbers?
